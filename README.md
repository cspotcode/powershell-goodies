A whole ton of stuff from my $HOME/Documents/(Windows)PowerShell directory, because it would be annoying to version it all separately.

"WslPowerShell": WSL should symlink to here from "~/.local/share/powershell"

"wsl-powershell-profile.ps1": WSL should symlink to here from ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
